            The information in this technical documentation page is for those wanting to know more about the app which is available for download via your app store.
            Each section will give you more information on how to access each section and a deeper explanation into what that does. As a guide we will show you more about:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to breed flowers, including how to create hybrid versions of these flowers</li>
            <li>Your daily checklist and what this means</li>
            <li>Turnip calculator - what is this used for and how to use it</li>
            <li>Collection progress and what this means</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you have downloaded the ACNH guide app from the relevant phone store you must first create an account.
            Once you have created your account and click on "home" you will see a list of your daily checklist. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Talk to residents</li>
            <p>
                You will need to add the residents on your island which you can do by clicking "Villagers" on the bottom shortcut menu. 
                When you go into the Villagers shortcut you can click "all" and then search for the villagers you have on your island.
            </p>
            <li>Turnips - we will cover this later on</li>
            <li>Fossils, money tree & recipe bottle</li>
            <li>Hit rocks</li>
            <li>Visitor tracker</li>
            <li>Events - such as birthday's</li>
            <li>Collection Progress</li>
            <li>Museum Progress - which shows what you have handed into the museum</li>
            <li>Catchable bugs for your season</li>
            <li>and last but not least! Catchable fish for your season</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All information within this guide is for my project via *FreeCodeCamp and is only my representation of the app and how to use it. It is not an officially licensed technical documentation page and has only been created for a project I am passionate about. It has also been created to fit certain criteria set by <code>FreeCodeCamp</code> which is why I have weird tags in weird places - because this isn't actually technical documentation! Thanks for reading.

    <p>
        To access the flower breeding guide on the ACNH app you will first need to click the little book icon in the top left of the app next to the date.
        Once you have done this click on "Flower Breeding Guide" and it will bring up a menu of flowers. Click on a flower of your choice and it will show "pairings". I have added a large photo of all the basic flowers you can buy (either from your island, Leif when he comes to visit or by visiting other people's islands and using their shop.)
        It also shows the hybrid varients for each flower. The flower breeding guide on the ACNH app goes into more detail. Showing you which 2 flower colours go together to make a third colour.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me give you an example. Lets click on the "windflowers". 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Normal red and normal orange make hybrid pink</li>
        <p>Do you notice a star next to the pink flower and a seed packet next to the red and orange flower? The seed packets represent a "normal" flower which you can buy from a shop. The star represents a hybrid version.</p>
        <li>Normal white and Normal white make hybrid blue</li>
        <li>Normal red and hybrid blue make hybrid red</li>
        <li>Hybrid pink and hybrid blue make hybrid red</li>
        <li> Hyrbid pink and Hybrid blue also make hybrid pink</li>
        <p>As we have seen with hybrid blue and pink they can reproduce hybrid pink and hybrid red. As you see the pairings there is also a percentage chance in each box. For example hybrid red and pink have a 100% chance to make hybrid red but only a 25% chance to make hybrid pink</p>
        <li>Hybrid red and hybrid red make hybrid purple</li>
        <li>Hybrid pink and hybrid pink make hybrid purple</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ok, so we've got the pairings <code>matched</code> correctly. How do we make them reproduce hybrid colours?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all we need to plant them correctly. The best way to plant your flowers is in a checkerboard pattern. Planting one, missing a space, planting one, missing a space. Then on the next row missing a space, planting one, missing a space, planting one etc.</li>
        <li>We need to water them!Flowers need water. You don't need to water them if it's raining. You have a higher chance of a hybrid colour to reproduce if someone else waters them for you.</li>
        <li>Make sure your flowers have lots of space to grow. This means digging up new spawns and planting them elsewhere. The great thing about the app is you can tick off when you have a hybrid colour variation helping you keep track.</li>
        <li>Don't do too many at one time. SOme flower types have less variations than others and some are more rare (like the elusive blue rose with only a 1.6% chance!</li>
        <li>Finally if you'd like the gold rose you need to plant 4 black roses in a diamond shape and water them with the gold watering can.</li>
    </ol>

            Turnips can be as simpleor as complicated as you want. But they are the main <code>money-maker</code> in the game. How you choose to do this whether it be; <code>Time travel</code>, <code>Visiting other islands</code></p>
