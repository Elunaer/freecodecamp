        About me
      </h3>
      <p>
        I started learning to code because I am currently stuck in a job I'm not too happy with. I have started with absolutely no experience but I'm finding it fun learning and using my brain again!
        Some of the projects you will see will be very basic but I'm hoping over time that I will improve and I can come back and make them more complex.
        The first few projects you will see on my GitHub profile are part of FreeCodeCamp projects so have to meet a certain criteria. I haven't been able to express myself or be creative in these.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also going to start a project with my partner and apply some of the knowledge I have learned. We will be treating it as a job and he will create tickets for me to work on so that when I finally am able to get a junior role I will have some working experience.
